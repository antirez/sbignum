Note for people from 2011: I don't remember very well the completeness
or the quality of this implementaiton. I'm lately trying to put on github
everything I coded in the past but I can no longer find in my HD.
When I find something on the internet that is possibly something I could reuse
or have fun reading the source in 20 years, I put it on github.
